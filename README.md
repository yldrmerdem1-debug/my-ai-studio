# Persona-First Ads Studio

A premium AI-powered content creation platform built for ads and creators. The platform focuses on generating content as a PERSONA, not just producing generic outputs—so every script, image, and video can reflect a consistent identity and voice.

## Core features
- Persona-first content generation for ads and creators
- Persona training for visual identity using 20 photos
- Voice persona training from user-uploaded voice samples
- Ad Script workflow: generate text first, then optionally convert to voice
- Video and Image tools that can use generic AI or a trained persona

## Persona-based generation vs generic AI
Generic AI generates content without a consistent identity. Persona-based generation produces content through a trained profile, so the output feels like a specific person or brand. This is the most valuable and expensive capability in the product, delivering consistent, high-quality creative across formats.

## Free vs Premium
Free usage focuses on generic AI generation. Premium unlocks persona training and persona-based generation across text, voice, image, and video—making it the core value of the platform.

## Tech stack
- Gemini for text intelligence and creative direction
- Replicate for image and video generation
- ElevenLabs for voice synthesis
